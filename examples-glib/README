Note: The example source do not use headers from source tree, i.e.
      libkeepalive-glib and libkeepalive-glib-devel packages need
      to be installed - similarly to real applications that would
      use the interfaces.

block-suspend.c
	Uses cpukeepalive_t to block suspend.

keep-display-on.c
	Uses displaykeepalive_t to block timer based display blanking.

periodic-wakeup.c
	Uses background_activity_t to periodically wake up from suspend.

simple-timer-wakeup.c
	Used g_timeout_add() lookalike functions to wake up from suspend.
