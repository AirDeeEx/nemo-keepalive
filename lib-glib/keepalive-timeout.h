/** Drop in replacement for g_timeout_add_full()
 *
 * Unlike normal glib timers, these can wake the device from suspend and
 * keep the device from suspending while the callback function is executed
 * by using IPHB wakeups from DSME and CPU-keepalive from MCE.
 *
 * Note that the wakeup time is not exact.
 *
 * The IPHB wakeups use 1 second resolution, so the milliseconds used
 * due to following the glib interface are rounded up to the next full
 * second.
 *
 * If the device needs to wake up from suspend, that happens via RTC
 * alarm interrupts. In that case clock source differences can cause
 * up to one second jitter in wakeups.
 *
 * And the triggering is scheduled via ranged IPHB wakeup. By default the
 * range that is used is [interval, interval + heartbeat seconds] - which
 * should guarantee that the device will not wake up solely to serve the
 * timer, but also means the wakeup can occur up to 12 seconds later than
 * requested.
 *
 * If more exact wakeup is absolutely required, the priority parameter
 * of G_PRIORITY_HIGH can be used and the wakeup is scheduled to occur
 * at range of [interval, interval + 1 second].
 *
 * @param priority  the priority of the timeout source. Typically this
 *                  will be in the range between G_PRIORITY_DEFAULT and
 *                  G_PRIORITY_HIGH.
 * @param interval  the time between calls to the function, in milliseconds
 * @param function  function to call
 * @param data      data to pass to function
 * @param notify    function to call when the timeout is removed, or NULL.
 *
 * @return the ID (greater than 0) of the event source
